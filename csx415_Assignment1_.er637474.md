#### BIo

My name is Eduardo Rosillo and I am an entry-level energy systems engineer who has worked closely with professional engineers, building managers, and business/administration associates on analyzing and managing the efficient use of energy in a building. After spending a few years in the industry and experiencing at first glance the business standards and practices of other industries from manufacturing to retail and lab settings; I have come to value of my performance in data analysis and data gathering. It is for this reason I have enrolled in this course/certificate program as I hope to develop some aptitude in this field.

I have been a member of a team contracted to perform an energy audit Westfield San Francisco, Ca Center; this analysis considered all of the electric /gas powered technologies utilized by a 1.25 million square-foot retail area. He has also performed Energy Audits and Benchmarking for a smaller office buildings as well as larger auditoriums/stadium centers. These audits often involve energy balances and gathering data recorded daily, over a 12-month cycle. These audits often involve large quantities of data which require intensive review and study.

#### Project Proposal

Project Proposal (in progress) The point of performing an energy balance of a building is to understand how energy is demanded by the client and then how it is consumed. When performing an energy balance over significant period of time (bi-annual to annual) for a large building, many variables have to be take into consideration. There are two ways to classify these variables.

-   Energy demanding variable: weather forecasting seasonal changes, holidays, areas of high/low foot traffic.

-   Energy expending variables: air cooling/heating and water consumption.

Purpose:

1.  Understand the relationships between energy demanding variables (high/low foot traffic, weather) and energy expending variables (air cooling/heating).

2.  Understanding the relationship between aforementioned variables, develop models predicting energy consumption

3.  Optimization of energy consumption
